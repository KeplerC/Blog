# A NOVEL APPROACH FOR AUTOMATIC ACOUSTIC NOVELTY DETECTION USING A DENOISING AUTOENCODER WITH BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM NEURAL NETWORKS

This paper introduces unsupervised approaches for acoustic novelty detection. It relies on auditory spectral features 

### keywords 
autoencoer: NN taht consists only one hidden layer

### thoughts 
novelty detection of sound: dimension is relatively low, thus can use low dimensional structures, like this autoencoder model.
