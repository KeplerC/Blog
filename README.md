# Blog

I will update what I read, what I think and this will be what I write. Because I am just a beginner and I will limited to my schedule, deadlines and potential unseen events, stopping to update is the least thing I want. Thus I sometimes divide things up and keep updating.  
for all the latest update, see /daily
